//Assignment:  Lab_4
//Date:        September 23, 2015
//Description: This lab will expand on us drawing in an applet environment, 
//             while adding to the concept of methods and functions.  We will
//             Design a function to draw a dice of a specific color, and will
//             draw a specific face of the dice.  IN MY IMPLEMENTATION,  I will
//             draw the dice using fonts rather than the traditional dice.
